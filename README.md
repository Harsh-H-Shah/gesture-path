# What Is Gesture Recognition?

Gesture recognition is technology that uses sensors to read and interpret hand movements as commands. In the automotive industry, this capability allows drivers and passengers to interact with the vehicle — usually to control the infotainment system without touching any buttons or screens.

## How it works

A gesture recognition system starts with a camera pointed at a specific three-dimensional zone within the vehicle, capturing frame-by-frame images of hand positions and motions. This camera is typically mounted in the roof module or other vantage point that is unlikely to be obstructed. The system illuminates the area with infrared LEDs or lasers for a clear image even when there is not much natural light.

Those images are analyzed in real time by computer vision and machine learning technologies, which translate the hand motions into commands, based on a predetermined library of signs.

## Most common gestures

- A single finger spun clockwise to turn the radio volume up or zoom in on a map
- A single finger spun counterclockwise for the opposite action
- A pointing gesture, with either one or two fingers, to accept a call
- A swipe gesture to reject a call
- Two fingers, without motion, controls a variety of other functions, such as muting or unmuting the audio

## Benefits

- Improved safety — drivers do not have to take their attention off the road as much as they would with touch controls
- Convenience of controlling vehicle functions with deliberate gestures rather than a potentially complex menu scheme

## The bigger picture

Gesture recognition is part of a broader camera-based interior sensing platform that can:

- Interpret voice commands, eye movements, and body movements
- Recognize the driver and adjust settings to preferences
- Monitor driver attentiveness and mood
- Take over braking functions in an emergency
- Switch between autonomous and human driving modes
